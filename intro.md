# Welcome to FastBox <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
# What is FastBox
We propose an innovative NFT system, called FastBox, by utilizing a modified weak consensus algorithm as the underlying supporting algorithms. Our design weakens the guarantee of strict consistency of transactions/states and relaxes the property of persistence [3,] in the NFT issuing progress, while retaining the strict consistency in the NFT transferring progress.



# FastBox High-level Workflow
Figure 1 depicts the architecture and workflow of our system. Totally, our system has three types of entities: **NFT owner**, **NFT buyer** and **NFT maintainer**.

- **NFT Owner**: An NFT owner is an entity that is in control of a distinct NFT. An owner's identity is also the main subject of the information in an NFT, and a holder is often the entity that initiates the transmission of an NFT.  

- **NFT Buyer**: An NFT buyer is an entity that buys an NFT from a particular holder. This process is completed by a transaction transferring through the blockchain network.

- **NFT Maintainer**: An NFT maintainer is an entity that maintains the NFT. Our proposed blockchain system completes this process.

Firstly, an NFT holder requests an NFT with registered information. After a successful registration process and a (passed), verified registered information, the NFT holder obtains an NFT. After that, the holder can show the NFT to an NFT buyer. Next, the NFT buyer can verify the received NFT by querying the blockchain.

# Key Benefits

- **Safe Storage**. The NFTs raw data on the chain proves the existence of uploaded certificates, even under unpredictable accidents such as machine shutdown or file damage.

- **Fast Confirmation**. A high-performance consensus mechanism without a linear ordered sequence for the system makes it applicable to the large-scale NFT minting scenarios.

# Other NFT Properties?

- **Atomicity**. Trading NFTs can be completed in one atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) transaction. The NFTs can run in the same shared execution state. Also, the system processes without relying on external entities, such as a third party.
- **Good Usability**. Every NFTs has the most up-to-date ownership information, which is user-friendly and information-clearly. Each user who participated in the game can easily buy, sell, trade, and exchange any product via NFTs.
- **Security**. The NFT and its trading records are persistently stored and impossible to manipulate once the transactions are deemed as confirmed.
- **Availability**. The NFT system never goes down or may just shut down for a very short time that cannot damage the metadata. This equal to say all the tokens and issued NFT will always be available to sell and buy.
- **Verifiability**. The NFT with its token metadata and its ownership can be publicly verified.

# Weak Consensus
Weak Consensus algorithm weakens the guarantee of strict consistency and relaxes the property of persistence. Weak consensus mainly guarantees that the relative sequences of blocks in one individual chain remain consistent with that in the other chains. As illustrated in Fig2, node `B` creates a serial of blocks `1, 2, 3, 4`. Our goal is to ensure that the sequence of  `(B1 -> B2 -> B3 -> B4)` can be correctly maintained across chains, no matter how many blocks (generated by other nodes) are inserted between them. Blocks in our model are required to receive replied messages from peers, saying that they have successfully stored the blocks. Whenever a block collects `commit` messages more than the threshold, it is deemed as confirmed.

Security properties:

- **Relative persistence**. Relative Property ensures that as soon as the relative position between two states has been confirmed by honest node, this relationship will ultimately be confirmed in every node in the network with high probability. The property guarantees that the relative positions remain consistent between two states across paralleled chains.

- **Liveness**. Liveness guarantees that all nodes eventually agree on a unique relationship each chain. The unique relationship represents the relative position between a state and its ancestor. The term eventually indicates that it may take a sufficient amount of time (within the upper bound of Î”) to reach the agreement. The property ensures that a state will either be abandoned or accepted, instead of permanently pending status.
